# 🧩 Inheritance (IS-A Relationship) in Python

---

## 🔹 What is Inheritance?

> **Inheritance** is a mechanism in Object-Oriented Programming that allows a new class (child) to acquire the properties and behavior of an existing class (parent).

- The **existing class** is called the **Base / Parent / Super class**.
- The **new class** is called the **Derived / Child / Subclass**.

---

### 🧠 Syntax:

```python
class Parent:
    # base class properties and methods

class Child(Parent):
    # derived class properties and methods
```

---

### ✅ Example:

```python
class A:  # Base / Parent class
    def method1(self):
        print("A class Method1")

    def method2(self):
        print("A class Method2")

class B(A):  # Derived / Child class
    def method3(self):
        print("B class Method3")

b = B()
b.method3()
b.method1()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
B class Method3
A class Method1
```

✅ Here,  
- Class `B` inherits from class `A`.  
- So `B` can access both **its own methods** and **parent methods**.

---

### 🧩 Real-World Example: IS-A Relationship

```
            Person
            *    *
     IS-A  *      * IS-A
          *        *
         *          *
    Employee        Student
```

🧠 Interpretation:
- `Employee IS-A Person`
- `Student IS-A Person`

This type of relationship represents **inheritance**.

---

## 🧠 Example: Inheriting Instance Variables

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 10
        self.y = 20
        
class B(A):
    def Details(self):
        print(f'x is {self.x}')
        print(f'y is {self.y}')

b = B()
b.Details()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
x is 10
y is 20
```

✅ The `B` class inherits both instance variables `x` and `y` from class `A`.

---

### ❌ Without Inheritance (Code Duplication)

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 10
        self.y = 20

class B:
    def __init__(self):  # Repeated code
        self.x = 10
        self.y = 20
    def Details(self):
        print(f'x is {self.x}')
        print(f'y is {self.y}')

b = B()
b.Details()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
x is 10
y is 20
```

🚫 **Problem:** Code duplication — If you modify logic in one class, you need to repeat changes elsewhere.  
✅ **Solution:** Use **Inheritance** for **code reusability**.

---

## ✅ Advantages and Disadvantages of Inheritance

### 🟢 Advantages:
1. **Code reusability** — eliminates redundant code.  
2. **Reduces code size** — simplifies maintenance.  
3. **Extensibility** — easily add new functionality (override methods).

### 🔴 Disadvantages:
1. **Tight coupling** — if the parent class changes, it directly affects all child classes.  
2. **Increased complexity** in deep inheritance hierarchies.

---

### ⚠️ Example: Tight Coupling in Inheritance

```python
class A:
    def m1(self):
        self.x = 10  # if changed, affects all child classes
        print(f"Value of x is {self.x}")

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.m1()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
Value of x is 10
```

If you modify `x` in parent class `A`, it automatically reflects in `B` —  
proving inheritance creates **tight coupling**.

---

### ⚙️ Example: Changes in Child Do Not Affect Parent

```python
class A:
    def m1(self):
        self.x = 10
        print(f"Value of x is {self.x}")

class B(A):
    def m2(self):
        self.x = 20  # local to B

b = B()
b.m1()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
Value of x is 10
```

✅ Child modifications don’t affect parent — the inheritance direction is **one-way**.

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Single Inheritance

### 📘 Definition:
In **Single Inheritance**, one **child class** inherits from one **parent class**.

```
Parent → Child
```

🧠 **Syntax:**
```python
class Parent:
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    pass
```

---

### ✅ Example 1 — Simple Single Inheritance

```python
class A:
    def method1(self):
        self.x = 10
        self.y = 20
        print(f"value of x is {self.x}")
    def method2(self):
        self.z = 30
        print(f"value of z is {self.z}")

class B(A):
    pass        

b = B()
b.method1()
b.method2()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
value of x is 10
value of z is 30
```

---

### ✅ Example 2 — Parent vs Child Access

```python
class A:
    def method1(self):
        print("A class Method1")
    def method2(self):
        print("A class Method2")

class B(A):
    def method3(self):
        print("B class Method3")

a = A()
a.method1()
a.method2()

b = B()
b.method3()
b.method1()
b.method2()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
A class Method1
A class Method2
B class Method3
A class Method1
A class Method2
```

✅ The **child class** can access both parent and its own methods.  
❌ The **parent class** can access only its own methods.

---

### ✅ Example 3 — Inheriting All Types of Members

```python
class A:
    a = 10
    print(f"value of a is {a}")
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.b = 15
        print(f"value of b is {self.b}")
    
    def method1(self):
        y = 20
        self.x = 30
        print(f"value of x is {self.x}")
        print(f"value of y is {y}")
        
    @classmethod
    def cm(cls):
        cls.cmv = 40
        print(f"value of cmv is {cls.cmv}")
        
    @staticmethod
    def sm():
        smv = 50
        print(f"value of smv is {smv}")

class B(A):
    pass        

b = B()
b.method1()
b.cm()
b.sm()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
value of a is 10
value of b is 15
value of x is 30
value of y is 20
value of cmv is 40
value of smv is 50
```

✅ The **child class (`B`)** can access:
- Instance variables  
- Class variables  
- Static methods  
- Class methods  
- Instance methods  
- Constructors of the **parent class (`A`)**
