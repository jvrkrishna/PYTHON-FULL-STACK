# 🧩 Multiple and Hybrid Inheritance in Python

---

## 🔹 What is Inheritance Recap?

> **Inheritance** allows a new class to reuse and extend the functionality of another class.  
> The new class (Child / Derived class) inherits attributes and behaviors (methods) from the existing class (Parent / Base class).

Python supports various types of inheritance:  
✅ Single  
✅ Multilevel  
✅ Multiple  
✅ Hierarchical  
✅ Hybrid

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Multiple Inheritance

### 📘 Definition:
> In **Multiple Inheritance**, a single child class inherits from **multiple parent classes**.

🧠 **Syntax:**
```python
class Parent1:
    pass

class Parent2:
    pass

class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
    pass
```

🧩 Diagram:
```
       class A         class B
             \         /
              \       /
               \     /
                class C(A, B)
```

---

### ✅ Example 1 — Multiple Parents, One Child

```python
class A:
    def method1(self):
        print('A class method1')

class B:
    def method2(self):
        print('B class Method2')

class C(A, B):
    def method3(self):
        print('C class Method3')

c = C()
c.method1()
c.method2()
c.method3()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
A class method1
B class Method2
C class Method3
```

✅ **Explanation:**
- Class `C` inherits from **A** and **B**.
- So `C` can access both parent class methods.

---

### ✅ Example 2 — Method Resolution Order (MRO)

If both parent classes have **the same method name**, Python resolves which one to call based on the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** — **left-to-right** order in inheritance.

```python
class A:
    def method1(self):
        print('A class method')

class B:
    def method1(self):
        print('B class Method')

class C(A, B):  # A has higher priority (leftmost parent)
    pass

c = C()
c.method1()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
A class method
```

✅ **Explanation:**
- Python follows **MRO (Method Resolution Order)**.
- It looks for `method1` in:
  - Class `C` → then in Class `A` → then in Class `B` → finally in `object`.

🧠 You can check the MRO using:
```python
print(C.mro())
```

🧾 Output:
```
[<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class 'object'>]
```

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example: Multiple Inheritance

```python
class Father:
    def skills(self):
        print("Father: Driving, Cooking")

class Mother:
    def skills(self):
        print("Mother: Dancing, Singing")

class Child(Father, Mother):
    def skills(self):
        print("Child: Playing")
        super().skills()  # Calls Father (first in MRO)

c = Child()
c.skills()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
Child: Playing
Father: Driving, Cooking
```

✅ **Explanation:**
- The `super()` call in `Child` goes to the **first parent** in the MRO (Father).
- MRO ensures consistent and predictable order.

## 🧩 2️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance

### 📘 Definition:
> **Hybrid Inheritance** is a combination of **two or more types** of inheritance (e.g., Single + Multilevel, Multiple + Hierarchical, etc.).

🧩 It represents **complex relationships** between multiple classes.

---

### 🧩 Diagram:

```
           class A
          /       \
     class B        class C
          \         /
           \       /
             class D
```

Here:
- A → B and C represent **Hierarchical Inheritance**
- B and C → D represent **Multiple Inheritance**

So the total pattern forms a **Hybrid Inheritance**.

---

### ✅ Example — Hybrid Inheritance (Hierarchical + Multiple)

```python
class A:
    def method1(self):
        print("A class method1")

class B(A):
    def method2(self):
        print("B class method2")

class C(A):
    def method3(self):
        print("C class method3")  # Hierarchical Inheritance

class D(B, C):
    def method4(self):
        print("D class method4")  # Multiple Inheritance

d = D()
d.method1()
d.method2()
d.method3()
d.method4()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
A class method1
B class method2
C class method3
D class method4
```

✅ **Explanation:**
- `B` and `C` are derived from `A` (Hierarchical Inheritance).  
- `D` is derived from both `B` and `C` (Multiple Inheritance).  
- Together, this structure forms **Hybrid Inheritance**.

---

### 🧠 MRO in Hybrid Inheritance

```python
print(D.mro())
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
[<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]
```

✅ **MRO ensures that Python knows which class method to execute first**, preventing ambiguity.

---

## ⚙️ `super()` Function and Constructor Chaining

> The `super()` function in Python is used to **call the parent class’s method or constructor**.

---

### ✅ Example — Using `super()` in Multiple Inheritance

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print("A Constructor")

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("B Constructor")

class C(B):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("C Constructor")

c = C()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
A Constructor
B Constructor
C Constructor
```

✅ **Explanation:**
- Each `super()` call triggers the parent constructor.
- This ensures **constructor chaining** through the inheritance hierarchy.

## 🧩 Hybrid Real-World Example: Educational Hierarchy

```python
class Person:
    def details(self):
        print("I am a Person")

class Teacher(Person):
    def teach(self):
        print("I teach Students")

class Student(Person):
    def study(self):
        print("I am learning")

class TeachingAssistant(Teacher, Student):
    def assist(self):
        print("I help the teacher and students")

ta = TeachingAssistant()
ta.details()
ta.teach()
ta.study()
ta.assist()
```

🧾 **Output:**
```
I am a Person
I teach Students
I am learning
I help the teacher and students
```

✅ **Explanation:**
- `Teacher` and `Student` both inherit from `Person` → Hierarchical Inheritance.  
- `TeachingAssistant` inherits from both `Teacher` and `Student` → Multiple Inheritance.  
- Together they form **Hybrid Inheritance**.
