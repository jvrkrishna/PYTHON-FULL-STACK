# 🧺 Python Collections — Introduction

---

## 🔹 What are Collections in Python?

**Collections** in Python are **data structures** that allow us to **store, manage, and organize multiple values** together within a single variable.  
They make it easy to handle groups of related data efficiently instead of creating multiple variables.

In simple terms:
> Collections are containers that hold multiple data items — like lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries.

## 🔹 Why Use Collections?

✅ To store multiple data values in one variable  
✅ To group related data (like names, marks, products, etc.)  
✅ To access, modify, and organize data easily  
✅ To reduce code complexity and improve readability  
✅ To perform bulk operations (searching, sorting, counting, etc.)

## 🔹 Key Properties of Collections

| Property      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Ordered**   | The data elements are stored in a specific sequence. |
| **Unordered** | The order of data elements is not fixed. |
| **Mutable**   | The elements can be changed after creation. |
| **Immutable** | The elements cannot be changed once created. |
| **Indexed**   | Each element has a specific position for access. |
| **Unique Elements** 
                | Some collections store only unique items (no duplicates).    |

## 🔹 Importance of Collections

Collections are widely used in every Python program because:
- They **reduce redundancy** by grouping related data.  
- They allow **easy manipulation** of large datasets.  
- They are the **foundation** of most Python data handling tasks (loops, functions, APIs, etc.).  
- They make code **more efficient and readable**.
